# React Testing Library

## (@testing-library/react)

Before jump to React Testing Library we can understand basic React testing at [testing-recipes](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing-recipes.html)

---

## Rendering component

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";

import Simple from "./Simple";

describe("simple", () => {
  it("Should render", () => {
    render(<Simple />);

    screen.debug();
  });
});
```

---

## Rerender

---

## Querying elements

```jsx
const { getByText } = render(<Simple name="Jean" />);

expect(getByText("Hello, Jean!"));
```

---

---

## Fire event

```jsx
const button = getByTestId("request-profile");

fireEvent.click(button);
```

---

## React Testing Library encourage web accessibility
